This module teaches how to package python files into egg, source & binary distribution. 

There are many ways to package python modules, where setuptools modules is required to do this.


The following is the basic content of setup.py:

    from setuptools import setup
    setup(name='PythonPackaging',
          version='0.1',
          description='Sample Python package',
          url='https://github.com/smruthiEJ/PythonPackaging',
          author='Smruthi Elapavuluri',
          author_email='jsmruthi@gmail.com',
        #  install_requires=['any packages that are pre-reqs for this package to get installed'] 
          license='OpenSource',
          packages=['date'],
          scripts=['hello.py'], zip_safe=True)
         
zip_safe= True --> will not unzip the egg file once installed. 
packages=['date'] --> includes the python modules that have .py files and which are to be packaged.

Building packages: 

Run:

Python setup.py bdist_egg sdist bdist 

This generates following under the dist/ folder

  PythonPackaging-0.1.linux-i686.tar.gz  
  PythonPackaging-0.1-py2.7.egg  
  PythonPackaging-0.1.tar.gz
  
To intall the sdist/bdist run

  pip install PythonPackaging-0.1.linux-i686.tar.gz /PythonPackaging-0.1.tar.gz
  
To install egg file run

  easy_install PythonPackaging-0.1-py2.7.egg
  
All the installed files get copied to /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages depends on the location of
in your system. 

You can quickly check that using the following:
<neon>$python
>>> import site; site.getsitepackages()
[list of locations for site-packages.]


To see what other options setup.py provides, one can simply try the help command. 
  python setup.py --help
  python setup.py --help-commands
  
  Simplified: 
  
   python setup.py [global_opts] cmd1 [cmd1_opts] [cmd2 [cmd2_opts] ...]
   or: setup.py --help [cmd1 cmd2 ...]
   or: setup.py --help-commands
   or: setup.py cmd --help
